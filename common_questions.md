### 1. Tell me about yourself / walk me through your resume.
   -    Make a narrative out of your resume. Highlight a couple top accomplishments and then focus on why you are a good fit for their company.
   
    I am currently a junior at the University of Texas at Arlington, majoring in Computer Science with a focus on Cyber Security, Web Development and Software Development. With my father and brother being engineers, my childhood and teens was spent around professionals, listening to their anecdotes learing from the field. With my early interest in computers, Computer Science became the obvious choice for me to build my career in. I have been working part-time at my university's office for Information Technology for the past 2 and a helf years where we provide technical support to the university's staff and faculty members. This has served as a stepping stone for my career in IT and I have learned a lot about customer interaction, troubleshootng, technical documentation, problem solving etc. and I have also learned a lot from the senior members in the team. I also have some experience in freelance writing and photography that has come in handy several times. I am also a staff member with the E-Sports club at the university which has helped me gain an insight into the gaming industry as well. My goal is to be working on projects and products in a professional setting and I know that in order to get there I need to gain more experience and advance my skillset. I know I could learn a great deal from you and your staff which is why I am really excited in talking to you today and I am really interested in becoming an intern for you this coming summer.

### 2. What do you consider to be your key strengths?
    With my experience in the freelance market adn the customer service market and the knowledge I have gained from personal and school projects as well as coursework, I would consider customer interaction, app testing, documentation and guide prepration, web and app design to be at the top among my key strenghts. With my recent interest in UX design, I am hoping to add interactive protyping to the list as well. Furthermore, I have been told by my manager and colleagues that I pick up tend to pick up new instructions quickly. I have worked with and trained a few student works as well which has helped me become a good team player. I am also very particular about details, design and deadlines and make keen observations quickly which is why I would consider myself to be a good problem solver as well.

### 3. What is a weakness of yours?
    I tend to have a hard time asking for help. I personally learn by doing and sometimes that means I bite off more ethan I can chew in the process. For example, when workng on a recent group project for a database management class, I offered to build the entire front end for our app by myself. Even though I have built several small webapps, I have never built an entire app and I realised it was much more work than I had initially thought, but I was determined to figure it out on my own which is why I started learing about interactive prototyping. But sinc ethen, I have realised by working on other projects, be it for class or work, that I could learn more by partnering up with some of the other people in my team and brainstorming solutions together. By brainstorming ideas and putting our skills together, not only would we have completed this project faster, but I would have gained some new perspective but I owuld have been a lot less stressed by asking for some help upfront. 

### 4. What do you like to do in your spare time?
    In my spare time, I usually tend to read a book, listen to a podcast or solve some algorithm based problems on websites like LeetCode. Since summer of 2020, I have also been working on my prsoanal website, so I like to work on that as well.

### 5. How do you stay organized?
     Being a junior in college alongside having a part time job and pursuing some freelance opportunities, I have come to use several tools to stay organized. All my classes, project deadlines and meetings stay on google calander which gives me the ability to access them from any device. I also use an app called minimalist where I keep track of my long term and short term goals which helps me stay motivated.

### 6. How do you react to pressure or stressful situations?
    Recently, we completed a university wide project of migrating all devices from windows 7 to windows 10 which I was co-managing. This being a poject, had the eyes of many high profile people on it, which made the entire situation quite stressful. The pressure started building when the deadline was only 3 weeks away and we had a lot of faculty members not replying to our emails as they were unwillng to switch to a new OS which they would have to relearn entirely. We started writing knowledge base articles to help the users with the new OS, as well as we set up longer appointments so that they could as us any questions they had. We were able to convince our supervisors to extend the project deadline as well. With all that and a few more weeks of hard work, we were able to successfully complete the project 1 ekk earlier than the new deadline.

### 7. How would you describe your working/learning style?
    Traditionally I have been an independent learner. I like to learn new thi
